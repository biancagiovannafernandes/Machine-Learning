# Pulmonary Disease Classification
## Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on the automatic classification of lung X-ray images using classical Machine Learning techniques.
It aims to support medical diagnosis by identifying:

- Normal
- COVID-19
- Viral Pneumonia

---

## Project Overview

This project uses hand-crafted features extracted from medical images and applies dimensionality reduction and classification models to achieve accurate predictions.

It was developed as an academic project at INSA Rennes.

## Dataset
Link to download our dataset:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1EWBklmisc5AMh_X3QHu8UuC6fVRwRs4k?usp=sharing

The dataset is divided into three parts:

| Set        | Images |
|------------|---------|
| Training   | 125     |
| Testing    | 66      |
| Validation | 30      |

### Class Distribution

- Normal: 25 images
- COVID-19: 50 images
- Pneumonia: 50 images

The dataset is balanced.

---

## Data Preprocessing

All images are processed using the following steps:

- Resize to 224 × 224
- Convert to grayscale
- Normalization
- Missing value removal
- Feature scaling

---

## Feature Extraction (68 Features)

Each image is represented using 68 hand-crafted features:

| Feature Type        | Dimensions |
|---------------------|------------|
| Luminance Histogram | 32         |
| Texture (LBP)       | 26         |
| Hu Moments          | 7          |
| Density Features    | 3          |

## Dimensionality Reduction

### PCA (Principal Component Analysis)

- Preserves 95% of variance
- Reduces dimensionality

### LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)

- Improves class separation
- Used before k-NN

---

## Classification Models

### k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)

- k = 9
- Manhattan distance

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

- Linear and RBF kernels
- Class balancing

### Ensemble Learning

- Combines SVM and k-NN
- Improves final predictions

---

## Results

| Metric            | Value   |
|-------------------|---------|
| Train Accuracy    | 87.92%  |
| Test Accuracy     | 84.85%  |
| SVM AUC           | 0.97    |
| COVID Sensitivity | 92.3%   |

The models show good generalization and low overfitting.

## Data Path Configuration (Notebook)

Before running the notebook, open `Projet_MLIP.ipynb` and edit the first cell:

path_train = "/your/path/to/train"
path_test = "/your/path/to/test"
path_val = "/your/path/to/validation"

Make sure the paths match your local dataset location.
